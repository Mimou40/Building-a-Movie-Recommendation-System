# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview

This project involves building a movie recommendation system using the dataset provided. The system leverages collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset (`movies.csv`) contains detailed information about various movies, including:

- **Budget**: The budget of the movie.
- **Genres**: The genres the movie belongs to.
- **Original Title**: The original title of the movie.
- **Overview**: A brief summary of the movie's plot.
- **Popularity**: The movie's popularity score.
- **Release Date**: The date the movie was released.
- **Revenue**: The revenue generated by the movie.
- **Runtime**: The duration of the movie in minutes.
- **Title**: The title of the movie.
- **Vote Average**: The average user rating of the movie.
- **Vote Count**: The number of votes the movie received.
- **Cast**: The main actors in the movie.
- **Crew**: The crew members who worked on the movie.
- **Director**: The director of the movie.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user behavior and preferences.
- **User-Based and Item-Based Recommendations**: Offers both user-centric and item-centric recommendation approaches.
- **Scalable Solution**: Designed to handle large datasets of users and movies.

## Project Structure

- **`Building_a_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the movie recommendation system.
- **`movies.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the recommendation system.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of Python libraries required to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommendation-System.git
   cd Movie-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Building_a_Movie_Recommendation_System.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook includes steps to preprocess the movie dataset.
- **Model Training**: Train recommendation models using collaborative filtering techniques.
- **Making Predictions**: Use the trained models to predict movie recommendations for users.

## Future Enhancements

- **Incorporate Content-Based Filtering**: Combine collaborative filtering with content-based approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **User Interface**: Develop a web or mobile interface for users to interact with the recommendation system.
- **Real-Time Recommendations**: Implement real-time data processing for instant recommendations.
